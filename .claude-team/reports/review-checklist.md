## üéØ **Pre-Review Automated Checks**

Before human review, ensure all automated checks pass:

### **Code Quality Gates**
- [ ] `go fmt` - Code is properly formatted
- [ ] `go vet` - Static analysis passes
- [ ] `golangci-lint run` - Comprehensive linting passes
- [ ] `go mod tidy` - Dependencies are clean and minimal
- [ ] `gosec ./...` - Security scanning passes
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials

---

## üîç **Manual Review Checklist**

### **1. Code Structure & Organization**

#### **Project Layout**
- [ ] Files are in appropriate directories (`cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`)
- [ ] Package names are lowercase, single words
- [ ] File names use snake_case convention
- [ ] Interfaces are in separate files from implementations
- [ ] Mock files are properly generated and placed

#### **Import Organization**
- [ ] Standard library imports first
- [ ] Third-party imports second
- [ ] Project imports last
- [ ] No unused imports
- [ ] Import aliases are meaningful (avoid single letters)

```go
import (
    // Standard library
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"

    // Third-party
    "cloud.google.com/go/spanner"
    "go.uber.org/zap"

    // Project
    "github.com/company/pipe/internal/models"
    "github.com/company/pipe/pkg/config"
)
```

### **2. Go Best Practices**

#### **Error Handling**
- [ ] All errors are properly handled (no ignored errors)
- [ ] Errors are wrapped with context using `fmt.Errorf("operation: %w", err)`
- [ ] Custom error types are used where appropriate
- [ ] Sentinel errors are defined for known conditions
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive and actionable

#### **Context Usage**
- [ ] All I/O operations accept `context.Context` as first parameter
- [ ] Context is properly propagated through call chain
- [ ] Appropriate timeouts are set for operations
- [ ] Context cancellation is respected
- [ ] Context values are used sparingly and with typed keys

```go
// ‚úÖ Good
func (s *Service) ProcessCall(ctx context.Context, callID string) error {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 30*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    // Implementation...
}

// ‚ùå Bad
func (s *Service) ProcessCall(callID string) error {
    // No context handling
}
```

#### **Concurrency Safety**
- [ ] Shared data structures are protected with mutexes
- [ ] Channel operations handle closure properly
- [ ] Worker pools implement graceful shutdown
- [ ] Race conditions are avoided
- [ ] Goroutines don't leak

### **3. Security Review**

#### **Authentication & Authorization**
- [ ] HMAC signature verification is implemented correctly
- [ ] Constant-time comparison is used for signature validation
- [ ] Tenant isolation is enforced in all database queries
- [ ] No tenant data cross-contamination is possible
- [ ] API endpoints validate caller permissions

#### **Input Validation**
- [ ] All user inputs are validated before processing
- [ ] Validation uses appropriate libraries (`validator/v10`)
- [ ] SQL injection is prevented with parameterized queries
- [ ] URL/path parameters are validated
- [ ] File uploads (audio) are validated for type and size

#### **Secret Management**
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Google Secret Manager is used for credential storage
- [ ] Secrets are accessed securely and cached appropriately
- [ ] API keys are not logged or exposed in errors

```go
// ‚úÖ Good - Using Secret Manager
func (s *Service) getCallRailSecret(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
    return s.secretManager.GetSecret(ctx, "callrail-webhook-secret")
}

// ‚ùå Bad - Hardcoded secret
const webhookSecret = "my-secret-key"
```

### **4. Multi-Tenant Compliance**

#### **Tenant Isolation**
- [ ] All database queries include `tenant_id` in WHERE clause
- [ ] Row-level security is enforced
- [ ] No data leakage between tenants is possible
- [ ] Tenant context is validated before data access
- [ ] Logging doesn't expose other tenants' data

#### **Configuration Management**
- [ ] Tenant-specific configurations are properly isolated
- [ ] Default configurations are applied when tenant config is missing
- [ ] Configuration updates are atomic and consistent
- [ ] Caching respects tenant boundaries

### **5. Performance Review**

#### **Database Operations**
- [ ] Queries use appropriate indexes
- [ ] Connection pooling is configured correctly
- [ ] Query limits are applied to prevent large result sets
- [ ] Batch operations are used where appropriate
- [ ] Transactions are kept as short as possible

#### **Memory Management**
- [ ] Large objects (audio files) are streamed, not loaded entirely
- [ ] Memory allocations are minimized in hot paths
- [ ] Resources are properly closed (defer statements)
- [ ] Goroutines are bounded and controlled
- [ ] Caches have appropriate TTL and size limits

#### **API Performance**
- [ ] Request timeouts are reasonable (< 30s for webhooks)
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented where needed
- [ ] Caching is used for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Async processing is used for heavy operations
- [ ] Circuit breakers protect against failing dependencies

### **6. CallRail Integration Specific**

#### **Webhook Processing**
- [ ] HMAC signature validation follows security standards
- [ ] Webhook payload is validated before processing
- [ ] Idempotency is handled (duplicate webhook delivery)
- [ ] Processing is asynchronous for heavy operations
- [ ] Failures are retried with exponential backoff

#### **Audio Processing**
- [ ] Audio downloads are streamed to Cloud Storage
- [ ] Speech-to-Text API is called with proper configuration
- [ ] Audio files are stored with proper lifecycle policies
- [ ] Transcription failures are handled gracefully
- [ ] Processing status is tracked throughout pipeline

#### **AI Analysis**
- [ ] Gemini API calls include proper error handling
- [ ] API quotas and rate limits are respected
- [ ] Analysis results are validated before storage
- [ ] Confidence scores are properly interpreted
- [ ] Fallback behavior is defined for AI failures

### **7. Testing Requirements**

#### **Unit Tests**
- [ ] All business logic has unit tests
- [ ] Tests cover both happy path and error cases
- [ ] Mocks are used for external dependencies
- [ ] Test coverage is >80% for new code

#### **Integration Tests**
- [ ] CallRail webhook end-to-end flow is tested
- [ ] Database operations are tested with real Spanner
- [ ] AI service integrations are tested

#### **Test Quality**
- [ ] Test names clearly describe what is being tested
- [ ] Tests are independent and can run in any order
- [ ] Test data is properly set up and cleaned up
- [ ] Edge cases and boundary conditions are tested
- [ ] Performance tests exist for critical paths

### **8. Documentation Review**

#### **Code Documentation**
- [ ] Public functions and types have meaningful comments
- [ ] Complex algorithms are explained with comments
- [ ] Business logic reasoning is documented
- [ ] API contracts are clearly documented
- [ ] Configuration options are documented

#### **API Documentation**
