# Standard Multi-Tenant Ingestion Pipeline - Moderate Budget

## Executive Summary
The standard solution provides a balanced approach to multi-tenant ingestion pipeline implementation, leveraging Gemini 2.5 Flash for cost-effective AI processing while maintaining robust scalability and performance. This architecture optimizes cost-to-performance ratio using proven Google Cloud services with standard configurations.

## Google Cloud Platform Architecture

### Core Services (Cost-Optimized)
- **AI/ML**: Vertex AI with Gemini 2.5 Flash for efficient reasoning and analysis
- **Compute**: Cloud Run with standard configurations for Go microservices
- **Database**: Existing Cloud Spanner instance (upai-customers) with standard features
- **Audio Processing**: Speech-to-Text API with enhanced models
- **Orchestration**: Cloud Tasks for queue-based workflow management
- **Networking**: Cloud Load Balancing with standard tier networking
- **Monitoring**: Cloud Monitoring and Logging with standard alerting

### Balanced Features
- **Intelligent Processing**: Gemini 2.5 Flash for content analysis and decision making
- **Scalable Audio**: Speech-to-Text API with speaker identification
- **Smart Routing**: Cloud Tasks with conditional workflow logic
- **Tenant Isolation**: Single database with optimized tenant_id partitioning
- **API Integration**: MCP framework for CRM and notification services
- **Regional Deployment**: Single-region with backup strategies

### Multi-Tenancy Pattern
**Single Database with Tenant_ID Partitioning**
- All tenants in single Cloud Spanner database (agent_platform)
- tenant_id as first column in primary keys for optimal locality
- Database splits automatically optimize based on tenant load
- Row-level security policies for data isolation
- Shared schema with flexible JSON value columns
