## üéØ ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL

### Continuous Monitoring (Every 2-3 minutes):
- Check agent progress and completion status
- Deploy new agents IMMEDIATELY when any agent completes
- Force handoffs if agents exceed 15 minutes
- Update status in orchestrator-status.json

### Next Deployment Queue (Ready to Deploy):
1. **backend-engineer-optimized**: Go project structure and CallRail webhook setup
2. **frontend-engineer-optimized**: Dashboard and monitoring UI planning
3. **test-designer-optimized**: Testing framework for microservices

### CRITICAL: NO WAITING FOR WAVES
- Deploy new agents as soon as ANY current agent completes
- Maintain exactly 5 active agents at all times
- Force handoffs prevent bottlenecks
- Continuous flow toward completion

**Next Status Check: 07:32 (3 minutes from now)**
