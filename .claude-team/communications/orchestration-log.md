# ðŸš€ Multi-Tenant Ingestion Pipeline - Orchestration Log

## Project Overview
- **Mission**: Build multi-tenant ingestion pipeline for home remodeling companies
- **Technology**: Go/Gemini agent, Cloud Run, Spanner, Vertex AI, Speech-to-Text Chirp 3
- **Budget**: $4,300-8,700/month | **Timeline**: 26 weeks | **Team**: 5-7 engineers
- **Started**: 2025-09-13T07:29:38Z

## Live Agent Status (Target: 5/5 Active)

### Wave 1 Deployment - LAUNCHING NOW (2025-09-13T07:29:38Z)

| Agent | Micro-Task | Status | Started | Target | Progress |
|-------|------------|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| requirements-analyst-optimized | CallRail integration requirements analysis | DEPLOYING | 07:29 | 15min | 0% |
| research-agent-optimized | GCP Speech-to-Text & Vertex AI research | DEPLOYING | 07:29 | 15min | 0% |
| system-architect-optimized | Multi-tenant Go microservices architecture | DEPLOYING | 07:29 | 15min | 0% |
| security-auditor-optimized | HMAC webhook security & tenant isolation | DEPLOYING | 07:29 | 15min | 0% |
| performance-engineer-optimized | Performance SLOs & monitoring requirements | DEPLOYING | 07:29 | 15min | 0% |

### Deployment Queue (Ready for Immediate Deployment)
1. **backend-engineer-optimized**: Go project structure and CallRail webhook setup
2. **frontend-engineer-optimized**: Dashboard and monitoring UI planning
3. **test-designer-optimized**: Testing framework for microservices
4. **code-reviewer-optimized**: Code quality standards and review process
5. **documentation-specialist-optimized**: API documentation and runbooks

### Critical Success Factors
- âœ… Maintain exactly 5 active agents at all times
- âœ… 15-minute maximum task duration (force handoffs if exceeded)
- âœ… Immediate deployment when any agent completes
- âœ… All agents must use MCP tools for enhanced capabilities
- âœ… Zero bottlenecks from slow agents

### Key Requirements Being Addressed
- Multi-tenant ingestion pipeline processing forms, phone calls (CallRail), calendar bookings, chat
- CallRail webhook processing with HMAC verification
- Audio transcription with Speech-to-Text Chirp 3
- AI analysis with Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Multi-tenant Cloud Spanner configuration
- Cloud Run deployment with auto-scaling
